# Code Templates



## Description

Code templates and examples in python3, currently mainly used in common algorithms.




## Supplementary explanation
1. It is written in **Python3**, but easy to extend to other languages, such as **Java**, **C++**. Just replace the python syntactic sugar and advanced tricks, maybe just less concise.

2. With my limited time and ability, here only covers **common** algorithms and python tricks. Almost enough for interview, but insufficient for competition.

3. I have tried my best to collect and summarize the most general and best-practice templates in particular area, but this version may not be the best solution. Or, it's really the best performance and most concise solution, but it's not the suitable for you. Within acceptable performance, **it is the best practice for you when you use it most conveniently**. 

4. Code templates is written by python with some **pseudo code**, so I use `self` and add stub functions to pass compiler's check. You should replace them with your particular logic according to the comments.



## Why Python?
With the help of Python's advanced language features and dynamic type, it can let us ignore redundant grammar, and totally focus on algorithm and logic.
In addition, it is popular, and I'm the fan of this language myself.




## Who is it for?

under construction



## Future work

Currently, it is mainly about data structure & algorithm and advanced python coding tricks. Maybe I will add other domain code templates, such as machine-learning, NLP.

## Thanks to
* All the examples come from [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com), and I have attached the problem id and brief description.

* LeetCode has a great OJ platform, and really suitable to do functional and performance test.

* Many templates and tricks are enlightened by discussion in LeetCode, thanks to all the coding masters.

* Special thanks to [Stephan Pochmann](https://leetcode.com/stefanpochmann/), really learned a lot from him.
