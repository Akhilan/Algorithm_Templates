# Code Templates



## Description

code templates and examples in python, currently mainly used in common algorithms.

It is written in Python, but easy to extend to other languages, such as Java, C++. 
Just replace the python syntactic sugar and dynamic type system, maybe just less concise.


## Supplementary explanation
1. With my limited time and ability, here only covers common algorithms and python tricks. Almost enough for interview, but insufficient for competition.

2. I have tried my best to collect and summarize the most general and best-practice templates in particular area, but this version may not be 
  the best solution. Or, it's really the best performance and most concise solution, but it's not the suitable for you.
  Within acceptable performance, it is the best solution for you when you use it most conveniently. 

3. Code templates is written by python with some pseudo code, so I use `self` and add stub functions to pass compiler's check
  you should replace them with your particular logic according to the comments.
  


## Who is it for?

## Future work

under construction

Currently, it is mainly about algorithm and advanced python coding tricks. Maybe I will add other domain code templates, such as machine-learning, nlp.

## Thanks to
* All the examples come from [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com), and I have attached the problem id and brief description.

* LeetCode has a great OJ platform, and really suitable to do functional and performance test.

* Many templates and tricks are enlightened by discussion in LeetCode. 

* Special thanks to [Stephan Pochmann](https://leetcode.com/stefanpochmann/), really learned a lot from him.
