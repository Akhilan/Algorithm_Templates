# Code Templates



## Description

code templates and examples in python, currently mainly used in common algorithms.



## Supplementary explanation
1. With my limited time and ability, here only covers common algorithms and python tricks. Almost enough for interview, but insufficient for competition.

2. I have tried my best to collect and summarize the most general and best-practice templates in particular area, but this version may not be 
  the best solution. Or, it's really the best performance and most concise solution, but it's not the suitable for you.
  Within acceptable performance, it is the best solution for you when you use it most conveniently. 

3. Code templates is written by python with some pseudo code, so I use `self` and add stub functions to pass compiler's check
  you should replace them with your particular logic according to the comments.

## Thanks to
* All the examples come from [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com), and I have attached the problem id and brief description.

* LeetCode has a great OJ platform, and really suitable to do functional and performance test.

* Many templates and tricks are enlightened by discussion in LeetCode. 

* Special thanks to [Stephan Pochmann](https://leetcode.com/stefanpochmann/), really learned a lot from him.
